This benchmark measures the performance of PPrint using an artificial benchmark
that involves randomly generating arithmetic expressions, converting them to
PPrint documents, and rendering these documents.

Caveat: very few of the PPrint combinators are exercised by this benchmark.

Use `make once` in this directory to run the benchmark just once.
Use `make bench` in this directory to run it several times
and obtain somewhat more reliable results.
